          Humans are a complex ecosystem of viruses, bacteria, and cells all sharing one body. 
          Sometimes viruses and bacteria don’t play nicely with our bodies and make us sick.
          While our bodies have some cool defense systems against disease, our infections can still slip past our defense and often can be found in unexpected places.
          One such place our illnesses can wine up is in our poop.
          poop, being covered in germs is not a new idea, but testing poop for specific infections is a resent development.
          However if an individual want to know if they have a disease or not, there are normally easier ways to test that then sending in a poop sample to a lab.
          While poop testing might be inefficient for an individual, what about testing a population?
          Americans are lucky enough to have a sewer system that carries away the waste we don’t like to think about, but there’s valuable information about disease in that sewer water.
          Wastewater epidemiology targets the collective fecal matter in the sewer system and tests the water for specific diseases.
          Wastewater epidemiology provides a way to gain valuable knowledge about a disease in an environment without needing to test all individuals in a population.
