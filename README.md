# PMMoV-Wastewater-Analysis

This repository focuses on the analysis of viruses extracted from wastewater in Kent county Michigan.
While most of the data in this repository was collected from various government agencies (links to the data below), the viral tracking data was provided by the Grand Valley State University Molecular monitoring team.
This repository was given permission by the Grand Valley State lab to make all the data used in this repository public.
This data repository will only explore a small aspect of the work being done on wastewater epidemiology so there may be some questions you might have about the data that will only be explained once the Grand Vally team decides to publish their resalts.
The conclusions of data made in this repository does not speak for the conclusions of the Grand Vally team, although some discussion has taken place to align our thoughts on the data.
I would like to thank the Grand Valley State University Molecular monitoring team for permiting me to use thire data and I would encurage others intresid in this reserch to read the publication when it becomes avalible
